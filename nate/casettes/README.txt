Hey Oliver,

Attached are csv files with q vs intensity for a single sample (the test sample that I shared in the meeting just now). There were 17 images taken for this one sample. I also have datasets with 44 images taken for a single sample, if that would be better.

I’m not sure if the difference between how I was processing the data was clear in the last meeting — if you want to discuss it more let me know and we can do that one on one.

Best,
Nate J
